# PAULIE WHITEPAPER

## Community-First Rewards on Solana

**Version 1.0** - January 2026

Paulie is a community-driven token on the Solana blockchain that revolutionizes the relationship between developers and holders. Unlike traditional projects where developers capture the majority of value, Paulie inverts this model with a **90% community / 10% developer split** of all protocol revenues.

Built by developers, for the community. Paulie proves that sustainable projects can prioritize holder rewards while maintaining the resources needed for continuous innovation and support.
